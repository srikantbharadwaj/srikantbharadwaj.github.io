## Heterogarnet

The [documentation for HeteroGarnet](https://www.gem5.org/documentation/general_docs/ruby/heterogarnet/) is now available on the gem5 main website. HeteroGarnet allows you to simulate modern interconnection networks such as 2.5D/3D NoCs, chiplet-based architectures, photonic interconnects. It also allows you to integrate the networks with the detailed CPU and GPU models of gem5 and simulate full-systems.

It is already being used by several industrial and academic research groups and this documentation tries to address most of the frequently asked questions we have been receiving.
