I am a Principal Researcher at [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/srbharadwaj/) where I work on hardware-software co-design for machine learning and high-performance computing applications in the [Systems Innovation Group](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/systems-innovation/). Before joining Microsoft, I worked as a Silicon Design Engineer at AMD Research for about 4.5 years where my research charter spanned GPU architecture, Network-On-Chips(NoCs), and cryogenic computing. Prior to joining AMD Research, I was part of the [Synergy Lab](https://synergy.ece.gatech.edu/) at [Georgia Institute of Technology](https://www.ece.gatech.edu/), Atlanta, GA, where I worked on TLBs, Network-on-chips and was also part of the [DARPA CHIPS program](https://www.darpa.mil/program/common-heterogeneous-integration-and-ip-reuse-strategies) under the supervision of [Prof. Tushar Krishna](http://tusharkrishna.ece.gatech.edu/). I receieved my Master's in Electrical and Computer Engineering from Georgia Institute of Technology in 2017 with a [thesis on distributed TLB architectures](http://hdl.handle.net/1853/59300). I later pursued my PhD under Prof. Tushar Krishna on design of interconnection systems for multi-chiplet GPUs. 

I graduated with a Bachelors in Electrical and Electronics Engineering from [BITS Pilani](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/), India, in 2014. I also spent some time working as a full-time engineer with [Oracle Solaris team](www.oracle.com) and [NVIDIA iGPU team](www.nvidia.com) in Bangalore, India. Some of my work from Oracle is also published in the form of [blogs](https://blogs.oracle.com/solaris/importing-a-zone-into-a-zone-cluster-configuration-using-the-new-import-zone-subcommand-v2).

I am also an active developer within the [gem5](www.gem5.org) community. You can find more info about the tools I developed and maintain in the tools tab.
